# Compare algorithms

We want to compare different machine larning algorithms prediction and accuracy, by testing
all available similarity and accuracy messures from the library "Surprise" in Python

### How to execute

1. install dependencies `pip -r requirements.txt`
2. create a virtual env `python -m venv .venv`
3. `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. run `jupyter notebook`
5. check the algorithms in `comparison_algorithms` folder
